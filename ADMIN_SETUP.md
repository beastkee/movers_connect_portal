# Admin Verification System Setup

## 🚀 Instant Registration Now Live!

Mover registration is now **instant** (~2 seconds) regardless of file uploads!

## How It Works

### For Movers:
1. Register with company details
2. Upload credentials (optional, happens in background)
3. **Account created immediately** - can login right away
4. Status: "Pending Verification" 
5. Can browse the platform but **cannot send quotes** until verified
6. Once approved by admin, full access is granted

### For Admins:
1. Go to `/admin` page (e.g., `https://your-domain.vercel.app/admin`)
2. View all movers with their details and credentials
3. Filter by: All | Pending | Approved | Rejected
4. Click "✓ Approve" or "✗ Reject" for each mover
5. Movers get instant access once approved

## Admin Access Setup

**Default Admin Account (Testing):**
- **Email:** `admin@admin.com`
- **Password:** `admin123`
- ✅ **No email verification required**
- ✅ **Auto-approved verification status**
- ✅ **Instant full access**

**Other configured admin emails:**
- `admin@moversconnect.com`
- `beastkee@example.com`

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Change the default admin credentials before production deployment!

**To add your email as admin:**
1. Open `pages/admin.tsx`
2. Find line ~27: `const adminEmails = [...];`
3. Add your email to the array
4. Commit and push changes

Example:
```typescript
const adminEmails = [
  "admin@moversconnect.com",
  "youremail@example.com",  // Add your email here
];
```

## Verification Statuses

| Status | Description | Mover Can Do |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Pending** | Awaiting admin review | Browse, view requests, cannot send quotes |
| **Approved** | Verified by admin | Full access - send quotes, receive bookings |
| **Rejected** | Admin rejected application | Browse only, contact support |

## 🚀 Quick Setup - Creating Admin Account

### Option 1: Register via UI (Recommended)
1. Go to your app's register page
2. Register as a **Client** (not mover) with:
   - Email: `admin@admin.com`
   - Password: `admin123`
3. Login with these credentials
4. Navigate to `/admin` page
5. You now have admin access!

### Option 2: Register as Mover
You can also register as a mover with `admin@admin.com` - the system checks the email, not the account type.

### Accessing Admin Dashboard
1. Login with `admin@admin.com` / `admin123`
2. Go to `/admin` URL directly:
   - Local: `http://localhost:3000/admin`
   - Production: `https://your-app.vercel.app/admin`
3. Start approving/rejecting movers!
